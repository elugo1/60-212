### Quick GLSL Facts (versus p5.js)

* GLSL is not JavaScript, even though it looks similar; it's more like C. 
* Semicolons are *mandatory*, not optional. 
* Variables must be declared with *types*. Use `int`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, etc. 
* The input values (arguments) and return values of functions are also typed.
* Numeric constants are interpreted differently depending on whether they have a decimal point. If you want 5 as a float, you must use `5.0`. Note that the syntax `5.0f` is illegal. 
* You'll need to explicitly convert from ints to floats: `int a = 3; float b = float(a);`
* Functions and global constants must be defined before they are used (i.e. earlier in the file).
* Vectors support many math operations. `pow(someVec3, 2.0)` will square all three values in `someVec3`.
* There's no `random` function! You'll have to copy-paste someone else's, or devise your own.
* There's no `PI` constant! You'll need to define it yourself.
* Values used for coordinates and pixel colors are all between 0...1.
* The origin is in the lower-left; `y` is reversed from p5.js.
* Data from the outside, such as mouse and current time, must be passed in as `uniform`.
* Vector components can be accessed with: `.xyzw` and `.rgba`
* `someVec3.xy = 3.0;` will set the x and y components of `someVec3` to 3.0.
* You can do component *swizzling*: `vec4 a = vec4(1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0); vec4 b = a.zyyw;`

### Some notable GLSL math functions:

* `type mod (type x, float y)`
* `type fract (type x)`
* `type inversesqrt (type x)`
* `type sign (type x)`
* `type clamp (type x, type minV, type maxV)`
* `type mix (type x, type y, type a)	`
* `type step (type edge, type x)`
* `type smoothstep (type a, type b, type x)`
* `float length (type x)`
* `float distance (type p0, type p1)	`
* `float dot (type x, type y)`
* `vec3 cross (vec3 x, vec3 y)`
* `type normalize (type x)`
