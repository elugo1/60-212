# Some Creative Technology Studios

Here is an informal and very partial list of some creative technology studios — the kinds of places where creative coders work. These companies lead in fields like interactive installation, information visualization, web design, interactive museum displays, cartography, experience design, live performance, experimental product design, and interactive entertainment. This list doesn't necessarily include many other types of organizations, such as game companies, mobile app design studios, academic research labs, corporate R&D labs, or interaction design studios, etc. that also employ creative technologists.
