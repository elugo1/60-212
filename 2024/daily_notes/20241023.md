### In-class GLSL exercises: 

We will conduct 4 brief exercises to make sure you know how to do stuff in GLSL. We will adapt code written by shader expert, [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/). 

1. Using GLSL in Shader.place, create a gradient using a **cosine palette**. Adapt code from [this Shadertoy project](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ll2GD3). 
2. Select one of these noise functions: [Value noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsf3WH), [Wave noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tldSRj), [Gradient noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdXGW8). Using GLSL in Shader.place, integrate the noise function, and fill the screen with noise. Mess around with the constants that control its properties.
3. Using GLSL in Shader.place, adapt one of the **2D distance functions** in [this article](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/). Create a simple scene in which pixels inside and outside the shape are two different colors. Now add an offset to the shape, bloating it. This [link](https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples?tab=readme-ov-file#shapes) may be helpful.
4. Let's **add a new uniform** to a p5+GLSL sketch. Fork [this sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2405238) from OpenProcessing. Create a uniform which will be used in place of one of the constants in the GLSL code. Modify the p5 sketch so that whenever the user presses a key, that uniform is set to a random value (provided by p5).
