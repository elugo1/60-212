## Previous Exit Ticket Questions

* *How and where do we submit assignments? Like our code?* OpenProcessing. I'm sorry this wasn't clear, I should have demonstrated it before the end of last class. 
* *Do you know your MTBI?* Do you mean Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or mild traumatic brain injury? It's been a while since I've done either. 
* *I'm worried that I do not have enough coding experience to succeed in the class.* Possibly, but I have confidence in you, and we're all here to help, and I threw you all out into the deep end for this first assignment. You should come to office hours!
* how will critiques be run? (presentation format, anonymous google form format, etc..)
NA
* *I know using AI is encouraged but is it alright if we don't use AI in the actual programming process if we don't want to?* Of course. 
* *Would there be an opportunity to learn how to use motion capture?* In a sense, yes; we will do some assignments that creatively interpret human joint positions captured using a webcam. However, we will not be using the Motion Capture lab in the basement of IDeATe. (My Experimental Capture course does that.)

> *How can I explain to a non-art person the importance and applications of creative coding?*

A terrific question. [**Here's my attempt**](importance.md) to respond.
