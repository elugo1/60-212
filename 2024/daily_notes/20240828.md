## Previous Exit Ticket Questions

* *How and where do we submit assignments? Like our code?* OpenProcessing. I'm very sorry this wasn't clear, I should have demonstrated it before the end of last class. 
* *Do you know your mtbi?* Do you mean Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or mild traumatic brain injury? It's been a little while since I've done either. 
* *how will critiques be run?* I like to mix it up and use many different approaches. It's important to me that these kinds of conversations be as non-excruciating as possible. For many of my assignments, it makes more sense to have "discussions" (e.g. comparing students' approaches, praising interesting solutions) than "critiques".
* *I know using AI is encouraged but is it alright if we don't use AI in the actual programming process if we don't want to?* 100%; of course. 
* *Would there be an opportunity to learn how to use motion capture?* In a sense, yes; we will do some assignments that creatively interpret human joint positions captured using a webcam. However, we will not be using the Motion Capture lab in the basement of IDeATe. (My Experimental Capture course does that.)
* *I'm worried that I do not have enough coding experience to succeed in the class.* Possibly, but I have confidence in *all* of you, and we're all here to help, and I threw you all out into the deep end for this first assignment. Also, you should come to office hours!

> *How can I explain to a non-art person the importance and applications of creative coding?*

* A terrific question. [**Here's my attempt**](importance.md) to respond.

## Review of Homework

> "The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house" — Audre Lorde

I want to cultivate your ability to *figure out how to figure out how to solve problems*. If you're struggling with a problem:

* Watch a tutorial! Where possible, I will link to relevant tutorial videos by [Dan Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain), [Patt Vira](https://www.youtube.com/@pattvira), [Xin Xin](https://www.youtube.com/@xinxin1011), and others. They're incredibly helpful!
* Ask a person for help! You can message me, our TA, each other, or your friends or housemates — or you can post to `#haaaalp` in Discord. *(Just credit to those who helped you, and explain what help they provided!)*
* Try asking an AI system for help, such as ChatGPT! *(Just credit the system you used, and explain the help it provided!)*

If I'm giving you a problem that could be solved entirely by AI, then one of the following things must be the case: 

* I'll be crystal *fucking* clear about the fact that I want you to do it yourself, regardless, OR
* I'm expecting you to use AI, *dammit*; why are you wasting your time, OR
* I didn't give you an interesting problem; it's my fault, OR
* You haven't found a way to make it *yours*—or you didn't even think to try

Some solutions by previous students:

## Technical Presentation

*Let's recap an entire semester's worth of introductory programming education in 20 minutes.*

* The [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) vs [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org)
* Graphics primitives, e.g. shape
* Graphics state, e.g. color
* Graphics transforms, e.g. rotation
* Iteration, e.g. `for` loops
* Conditional testing, e.g. `if` 
* Arrays
* [Arrays of Objects](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/objects-array-of-objects.html)
