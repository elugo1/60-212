### Teachable Machine Projects by CMU Alums

In using Teachable Machine, we're using work by several former CMU students. [Irene Alvarado](https://www.irenealvarado.com/) is a recent graduate of CMU's HCII program. [Gautam Bose and Lucas Ochoa](https://design.cmu.edu/news/design-alumni-pioneering-business-automation-through-ai-innovation) are recent graduates of CMU's School of Design. As employees of Google's Creative Lab, they helped develop Teachable Machine and its demos.
