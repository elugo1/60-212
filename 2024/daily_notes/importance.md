# Why is Creative Coding Important?

In one of our Exit Tickets, a student asked:

> *How can I explain to a non-art person the importance and applications of creative coding?*

Forgive me if my response leans too far into instrumentalizing the arts in the service of commerce, and justifying creative coding in terms of its value to STEM disciplines. But I assume that's the kind of person you're talking to here.

It sometimes happens that you will be asked to justify the value of art to some relative who only cares about things like utility and money. You know the type. I'm very sorry. I don't enjoy speaking about art within that framing, since art is rarely useful or lucrative. We have other reasons why we do it. But for what it's worth, here is some language that could be helpful. 

* In terms of earning a living: Creative coders earn livings in fields like game design, information visualization, user interface design, web design, mobile app design, educational software design, interactive advertising, interactive entertainment, data journalism, corporate R&D, and multimedia software development. These are large industries.
* We are all immersed in computer displays, and creative coders are the experts of designing for these displays. Creative coders sometimes have job titles like: creative technologist, design technologist, technical artist, procedural artist, data artist, interactive art director, computational designer, multimedia programmer, immersive experience designer, interactive media developer, etc.
* Creative coders explore the new aesthetics, social potential, and new forms of cultural expression made possible by computer technologies — in the same way that cinema and photography, which were the new media of previous eras, were made meaningful by artists.

Plenty of companies include creative technologists in their software development teams, because these artists are adept at: 

* innovating with heavily constrained resources
* dealing with ambiguity and multivalent perspectives
* dealing with adversity and volatility
* bringing criticality to an environment otherwise vulnerable to the achilles heel of nerd culture (techno-optimism and technophilic enthusiasm)
* predicting “shots from the outside”
* working as cognitive pioneers, prototyping and exploring the horizon of the recently possible
* acting as magnets to bring together unconventional combinations of skills and talents
* providing content to test tools, tools to test content, and prototypes of creative new ideas
* warning of the potentially negative impact of new technologies on society, where others may not be as acutely sensitive or perceptive to these forces.

Creative coding *courses* can be important because: 

* such courses help arts students develop engineering skills, giving them a boost in claiming a seat at the tables where technological agendas are set; 
* such courses can help STEM students get in touch with a different way of operating in culture, and using their skills to make innovative cultural artifacts, or simply to express themselves creatively.
* such courses help artists *learn the grain* of computation, as a material.
* students who pursue creative coding education develop superpowers that others do not, and through their hybridity become uniquely equipped to do things that otherwise take entire teams. 

### A Final Word 

If you create some weird little app and your relative asks, *"What's the use of that?"* — Tell them your software is "as useful as a song."
