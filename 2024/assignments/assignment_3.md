*Our second set of Deliverables is due at the beginning of class on Wednesday, September 4. The primary topics it emphasizes are: shape; iteration and nested iteration; controlled randomness, and graphics transformations. I estimate that it will take you about 4-6 hours.*

***NOTE: I will have office hours next Tuesday evening (9/10/24), most likely in the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry (CFA-111) from 6-8pm.***

#### Readings & Looking Outwards

1. **Looking Outwards #2.** Spend 10-20 minutes checking out the work of professional loopmakers like [Bees and Bombs](https://www.instagram.com/davebeesbombs/), [Melissa Rodriguez](https://objkt.com/profile/tz1UtTasn4DTyb9rHYnLAjxSQHfkvAWtBbAQ/created), [Cindy Suen](https://cargocollective.com/cindysuen), [Lucas Zanotto](https://www.instagram.com/lucas_zanotto/?hl=en), [Andreas Wannerstedt](https://andreaswannerstedt.se/projects), [Etienne Jacob](https://bleuje.com/animationsite/), [Paolo Ceric](https://patakk.tumblr.com/), and [DVDP](https://www.instagram.com/dvdp/). In the Discord channel *#Looking-Outwards-2*, embed or post a link to a loop that you appreciated, and write a sentence or two about what you liked.
2. **Reading**. Skim the article “[On Repeat: How to Use Loops to Explain Anything](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/on-repeat-how-to-use-loops-to-explain-anything)” by Lena Groeger, a journalist/developer/information-designer at ProPublica. This article is purely for your edification/entertainment; there’s no deliverable for this reading. It should take about 10-15 minutes to browse this elegant stack.
