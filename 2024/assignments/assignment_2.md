# Assignment Set #2

### Due Wednesday, September 4

---

*Our second set of Deliverables is due at the beginning of class on Wednesday, September 4. The primary topics it emphasizes are: shape; iteration and nested iteration; controlled randomness, and graphics transformations.*

*We are still in a phase of the course that emphasizes the development of basic programming skills, knowledge of your toolset, careful observation, and precision execution. This is not a particularly “open-ended” set of Deliverables (though the "Moiré" and "Maluma" projects have a good deal of room for creative expression). Things will open out more, soon.*
