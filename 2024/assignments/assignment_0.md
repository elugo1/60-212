*The following deliverables are due by the beginning of class on Wednesday 8/28.*

1. [*1 minute*] **Bookmark** our [Course GitHub](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/blob/main/2024/readme.md) in your laptop's browser, and **subscribe** to our class [Calendar](http://bit.ly/golancoursecalendar). 
2. [*4 minutes*] **Create** an ID on [Discord.com](https://discord.com/) (if you don't already have one). **Join** the class Discord, using the invitation sent to you by email. **Browse** the text channels so you know what goes where.
3. [*10 minutes*] **Create** an ID on [OpenProcessing.org](https://openprocessing.org) (if you don't already have one). **Join** our [OpenProcessing classroom](https://openprocessing.org/class/93074#/), using the invitation sent to you by email, and **bookmark** it in your laptop's browser. **Browse** a few of the sketches that people have published at [https://openprocessing.org/discover](https://openprocessing.org/discover). (Note: the quality varies widely!) Run the programs, and be sure to **look** at their code (*command-shift-return* may help switch to the code view). In the `#main-chatter` channel of the course Discord, **paste** a link to one or two projects that you found interesting. (No writing is necessary.) 
4. [*20 minutes*] **Review** the [Syllabus](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/blob/main/2024/syllabus/60-212_syllabus_fall2024.md) carefully, and **complete** the [**Welcome Form & Exit Ticket**](https://forms.gle/qa1upyvUXWk1dWra6).
5. [*20 minutes*] **Write** a "[Looking Outwards](https://github.com/golanlevin/lectures/blob/master/syllabi/looking-outwards.md)" post, as follows: 
	* **Recall** a project you have admired (prior to this course) which you feel falls under the broad umbrella of "Creative Coding". 
	* **Create** a post in the `#looking-outwards-1` channel in the course Discord. In a few sentences, **describe** the project, and **explain** what you like about the. It's sufficient to write 3-5 sentences. 
	* **Include** a link (URL) to the project or its documentation (such as a YouTube video).
	* **Embed** an image of the project in your post. 
6. **Ensure** you know where to find help: 
   * [*10 minutes*] **Browse** the [p5.js Reference](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/). Examine at least 10 Reference pages, starting with the Shape commands. Note that many of the Reference pages allow you to tinker with the code.
   * [*10 minutes*] **Browse** the [p5.js Examples](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/) archive, which are organized thematically. Review at least 10 p5.js Examples, skimming their code.
   * [*10 minutes*] **Browse** some of the many free YouTube tutorials for p5.js, including those by [Dan Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/playlists), [Xin Xin](https://www.youtube.com/@xinxin1011/videos) and [Patt Vira](https://www.youtube.com/@pattvira/playlists). Their offerings range from [completely introductory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) to impressively advanced. 
7. Do: 
   * Complete the project, OpenProcessing #01: Quadrilateral Composition. You are asked to create a composition comprised of three different types of quadrilaterals.
   * Complete the project, OpenProcessing #02: Good Shape. You are asked to design an organic blob shape by writing code that displays a static, closed loop.
   * Complete the project, OpenProcessing #03: Parametric Big N. You are asked to reproduce Al Held’s “The Big N” painting as accurately as you can in a static format; then, parameterize it interactively.
   * Complete the project, OpenProcessing #04: Critter Stamps. You are asked to create a function which abstracts the rendering of an oriented critter motif, with arguments for the critter’s position and rotation.

## Helpful Tools

*Remember, if you get stuck while making the projects, you can always give a shout in the `#haaaalp` channel in the course Discord.*

### Locating Pixel Coordinates

It can sometimes be challenging to locate the pixel coordinates you want. You may find it helpful to plan your design using [graph paper](https://print-graph-paper.com/), or by displaying your cursor's coordinates using something like the following (find the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/vvEg7XbQ4)):

### Choosing Colors

In can also be challenging to get the values that describe the color you want. You may find it helpful to refer to this [table of common Web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors) (which can help you refer to colors by name) as well as the [Digital Color Meter app](https://medium.com/mac-os-x/digital-color-meter-in-mac-machine-e961bedca040) that comes with MacOS. Additionally, you can easily access a color picker by [searching for one on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker):
