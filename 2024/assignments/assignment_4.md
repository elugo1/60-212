Attempts to mark time stretch back many thousands of years, with some of the earliest timekeeping technologies being gnomons, sundials, water clocks, and lunar calendars. Even today’s standard representation of time, with hours and minutes divided into 60 parts, is a legacy inherited from the ancient Sumerians, who used a sexagesimal counting system.

The history of timekeeping is a history driven by economic and militaristic desires for greater precision, accuracy, and synchronization. Every increase in our ability to precisely measure time has had a profound impact on science, agriculture, navigation, communications, and, as always, warcraft.

Despite the widespread adoption of technological standards, there are many other ways to understand time. *Psychological* time contracts and expands with attention; *biological* cycles affect our moods and behavior; *ecological* time is observed in species and resource dynamics; *geological* and *astronomical* rhythms can span millennia. In the twentieth century, Einstein’s theory of relativity further upended our understanding of time, showing that it does not flow in a constant way, but rather in relation to the position from which it is measured—a possibly surprising return to the significance of the observer.

Please look at the following 5 resources:

* Please read this this [**5-page text about timekeeping**](readings/drucker_timekeeping.pdf) (PDF) by design theorist Johanna Drucker, from her book *Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production* (Harvard Press, 2014).
* Please watch this excellent 6-minute YouTube video on the [**History of Timekeeping Devices**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsULOvIWSUo).
* If you didn’t already watch it in class on Monday 9/25, please watch the first 13 minutes of [**A Brief History of the Calendar and Timekeeping**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaYMK2n9Aow&t=4s), a YouTube lecture by [Dr. Donna Carroll](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dl-carroll), Lecturer of Physics, Maastricht University.
* Browse or skim the [**Wikipedia History of Timekeeping Devices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_timekeeping_devices).
* Check out [**https://yourcalendricalfallacyis.com/**](https://yourcalendricalfallacyis.com/). (It’s awesome!)

*Now:* In a Discord post in the `#timeKeepingReadings` channel, please write two sentences about something that stuck with you from any of these readings/viewings. What did you see that was interesting? Why was it interesting to you?
