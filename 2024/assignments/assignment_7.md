## 7.1. Looking Outwards: Shaders

*(10%, 30 minutes)* "Shaders" are special programs that can do fast and powerful things with pixels. Shaders are executed on your computer's GPU rather than its CPU, and use a C-like language called GLSL.

* **Spend 20 minutes browsing** the demos on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), a website that showcases shaders created by contributors from all over the world. **Observe** how the code for each shader is displayed (and editable). Many of the programs there are technical demonstrations rather than artworks; noting this, **try** out different search terms in the Shadertoy search field, such as: *voronoi*, *fractal*, *oklab*, *emboss*, *fluid*, *warp*, *raymarching*, *hdr*, *cloud*, *noise*, etc. 
* **Select** one shader that interests you. In the Discord channel `#07-shadertoy`, **provide** a link to the shader's URL, **write** a sentence about what you found interesting about it, and another sentence sharing an observation of the code that produced it. **Include** a screenshot of the shader.

## 7.2. Looking Outwards: Generative Art

*(10%, 30 minutes)* Below are some collections of generative artworks. Each page presents variations produced by a single piece of software art. **Browse** these pages and **select** a project that appeals to you more than the others. In the Discord channel `#07-generative-art`, **provide** a link to the project's URL, **write** a sentence about what you found interesting about it, and **include** an image of the artwork.
