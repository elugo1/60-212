### 1. Readings: Computational Color

(*10%, 30 minutes*) **Read** the following two articles: 

* [Computational Color](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-color/) by Rune Madsen (15 minute read)
* [*Okay, Color Spaces*](https://ericportis.com/posts/2024/okay-color-spaces/), Eric Portis, 2024. Includes interactives. (15 minute read)

*Now*: In the Discord channel, `#06-color-readings`, **write** a sentence of reflection about something that you found interesting or helpful from these readings. 

---

### 2. Interactives: Color Explorers

(*15%, 30 minutes*) **Interact** with each of the following interactive color explorers for a few minutes apiece: 

* [**Chroma.js Color Palette Helper**](https://gka.github.io/palettes/#/9|s|00429d,96ffea,ffffe0|ffffe0,ff005e,93003a|1|1)
* David Aerne's [**Poline**](https://meodai.github.io/poline/)
* David Aerne's [**Rampensau**](https://meodai.github.io/rampensau/).
* Cynthia Brewer's [**Color Advice for Cartographers**](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuPu&n=3)
* [**OK Color Picker**](https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/) by Björn Ottosson
* [**OKLCH Color Picker & Converter**](https://oklch.com/#77.33,0.141,123.88,100) by Evil Martians

*Now*: In the Discord channel, `#06-color-explorers`, **write** a sentence of reflection about something that you found interesting or helpful from these tools.

### 3. Four-Color Gradient

(*10%, 30 minutes*)

* **Read** or **skim** this article: [*Mastering Multi-hued Color Scales with Chroma.js*](https://www.vis4.net/blog/mastering-multi-hued-color-scales/)
* **Examine** this [Chroma.js+p5 example](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/2pkxnwYxF), especially the `scale` feature of Chroma.js. 
* **Create** a sketch that presents a smooth gradient through four colors. In a separate part of your canvas, display chips of the four colors in isolation. 
* **Respond** to this question, in a comment in your p5 code: *which color interpolation technique did you use and why?*
* **Save** your work to the correct slot in our OpenProcessing classroom.

### 4. Split Complements

(*15%, 30 minutes*)

A color’s “split complements” are a pair of colors that are opposite, but just adjacent (±15–30°) on the color wheel. Here, you are asked to create an interactive sketch that displays swatches of the split complements for a randomly generated color. *For this assignment, you are asked to use an advanced color library, such as [Chroma.js](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/2pkxnwYxF), [Texel/Color](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/Ya1xm67i6), [Mixbox](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/FPtOVXlpV): [Mixbox](https://github.com/scrtwpns/mixbox), [Color.js](https://colorjs.io/), or [Culori.js](https://culorijs.org/).*

* [**Modify** this sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/VtdpsUYLU) so that the chips are colored with split complements. Your program should generate a new set of colors each time the user clicks the mouse button. 
* **Save** your work to the correct slot in our OpenProcessing classroom.

### 5. 60-30-10 Composition

(*25%, 60 minutes*)

* **Watch** [this video about the "60-30-10 rule"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfjUOkbyr0).
* [This p5.js sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/U5EgeSwwR) presents a set of three colors in approximately 60-30-10 proportions. **Modify** [this sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/U5EgeSwwR) to use a satisfying trio of colors, replacing lines 14-16 with a generative strategy. Your program should generate a new set of colors each time the user clicks the mouse button.
* *For this assignment, you are asked to use an advanced color library, such as [Chroma.js](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/2pkxnwYxF), [Texel/Color](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/Ya1xm67i6), [Mixbox](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/FPtOVXlpV): [Mixbox](https://github.com/scrtwpns/mixbox), [Color.js](https://colorjs.io/), or [Culori.js](https://culorijs.org/).*
* *(FOR EXTRA CREDIT — If you would like to have a more creative version of this assignment: feel free to change the composition however you wish — so long as the three colors are still distributed in 60-30-10 proportions.)*
* **Save** your work to the correct slot in our OpenProcessing classroom.

(*25%, 45 minutes*)

### 6. Color Relativity:

* **Create** a program to generate novel color sets that always fulfill the *four-look-like-three* condition. Your program should generate a new set of colors each time the user clicks the mouse button. Demonstrate the relativity of color by duplicating the spots’ colors in a location where they can be more easily compared. 
* *For this assignment, you are asked to use an advanced color library, such as [Chroma.js](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/2pkxnwYxF), [Texel/Color](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/Ya1xm67i6), [Mixbox](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/FPtOVXlpV): [Mixbox](https://github.com/scrtwpns/mixbox), [Color.js](https://colorjs.io/), or [Culori.js](https://culorijs.org/).*
* **Save** your work to the correct slot in our OpenProcessing classroom.
